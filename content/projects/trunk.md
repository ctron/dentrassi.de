Trunk is a tool to:

> Build, bundle & ship your Rust WASM application to the web

It was created by [Anthony Dodd](https://github.com/thedodd), and I am currently maintaining it.

Trunk is a "bundler", similar to [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) or
[`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack), which orchestrates a Rust-based WebAssembly build for
the web (frontend). Including bundling all web resources and running a few additional tasks which make sense for a
frontend build (like minification, SRI digests, â€¦).
