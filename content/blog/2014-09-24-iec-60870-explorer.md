Finally we put a few functions and classes together that we already had, and made a simple, easy to use and jet powerful tool which we would liked to have ourselves ;-) Sadly it did not exist when we would have needed it, so we had to make it ourselves.

A simple tool to access data from an IEC 60870-5-104 device. Just browse the values and send some commands.

There are already a few products out there in this area, but either are they expensive and very complex applications that provide a lot more than you actually need. And are nearly unusable if you donâ€™t know what it is all about. Or they are simply crap.

Here is our approach to this problem: The [IEC 60870-5-104 Explorer](http://ibh-systems.com/iec60870/explorer).
