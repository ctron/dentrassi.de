Dear Google,

as a subscriber of Google Music I often search for music I listened to in the past. In many cases I do know the title, artist or sometime the name of the album.

<!-- more -->

But sometimes I just remember a fragment of the lyrics. However, searching for a fragment from the lyrics brings up nothing useful in Google Music.

So please Google, allow me to search not only for meta data like title, artist or album, but also for lyrics.

And while you are at it, please also let me limit the search afterwards, like a time period (the 90s), a genre (Rock), a language (some German bands do use English album title, but produce German lyrics), a country of origin (yes, German bands are capable of singing English lyrics).

You are the <q>search giant</q> … aren’t you?
