The deadline for the evaluations of phase for Google Summer of Code are pretty close. So it was time to take another look at what [Arthur](https://github.com/arthurdeschamps) did with the logistics simulation for [Eclipse Kapua](https://www.eclipse.org/kapua/).

<!-- more -->

The first phase was focused on creating a simple logistic network simulation and pushing telemetry data to Eclipse Kapua. The data isn’t realistic and that is ok, since this never was a requirement for the simulation. The second phase was focused around creating a simple dashboard for visualizing the data generated by the simulator.

So let’s have a quick look:

 <style>
			#gallery-4 {
				margin: auto;
			}
			#gallery-4 .gallery-item {
				float: left;
				margin-top: 10px;
				text-align: center;
				width: 50%;
			}
			#gallery-4 img {
				border: 2px solid #cfcfcf;
			}
			#gallery-4 .gallery-caption {
				margin-left: 0;
			}
			/* see gallery_shortcode() in wp-includes/media.php */
		</style><div class="gallery galleryid-3632 gallery-columns-2 gallery-size-medium" id="gallery-4"><dl class="gallery-item"> <dt class="gallery-icon landscape"> [![](https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/kapua_sim_1-1-300x192.png)](https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/kapua_sim_1-1.png) </dt> <dd class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-4-3633"> Kapua logistics simulator – world overview </dd></dl><dl class="gallery-item"> <dt class="gallery-icon portrait"> [![](https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/kapua_sim_2-297x300.png)](https://dentrassi.de/wp-content/uploads/kapua_sim_2.png) </dt> <dd class="wp-caption-text gallery-caption" id="gallery-4-3634"> Kapua logistics simulator – economic overview </dd></dl>  
 </div>Now, as you can see, trains driving through oceans isn’t that realistic ;-) But we agreed on not taking things like this under consideration. Companies and locations are  
randomly generated and figuring out which vehicles could drive on which roads between locations would simple be too much for this project.

The dashboard component is implemented using [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and simply because it was considered cool ;-)

There are still a few rough edges and the next phase will be focused on cleaning things up and making it consumable by people to play around with it.
