Dear Google,

since I did not find a better play to post this idea, I just did it right here ;-)

For openSCADA, the open source project I am working on, we use Google Groups as a communication channel with end users. This works quite fine actually, and I think that Google Groups are a fine instrument for that.

Sadly, when I browse through the Play Store, reading comments on apps, very often I find comments like “How can I…”. The comments, and also the possible replies are misused a form of forum, or back and forth communication channel. The next this is that the original comment gets updated to reflect a reply. All this is quite irrelevant, when I want to check if the app is worth a download or not.

On the other hand, my experience with Google Groups is, that very often users already help each other, and only when the question remains open for some time, or the question is rather specific we answer it ourselves.

I why don’t you just allow an automatic “per-app” Google Group, integrated into the Play Store App (but also accessible using the normal Google Group Website), to let users write about the app, provide self support, and provide a support forum for the application developer.

Well, I hope you read it some time.

You know were to find me ;-)
