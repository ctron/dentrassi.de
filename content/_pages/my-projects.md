Actually it is repository for all kinds of software artifacts (like JAR files, Debian and RPM packages, …) which can extract metadata, transform artifacts and render out different repository formats (like Eclipse P2, OSGi R5, Maven, APT, YUM, …).

## Eclipse SCADA &amp; openSCADA

See <http://eclipse.org/eclipsescada> and <http://openscada.org>.

An open Source SCADA System. Most of the openSCADA project has been migrated to Eclipse SCADA but there are some modules which do not fit into the EPL based license platform which the Eclipse Foundation follow. So openSCADA now is like an “add-on” to Eclipse SCADA.
