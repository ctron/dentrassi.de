> Sometimes found employed on Vogon Constructor Fleets, the Dentrassis are The best cooks and The best drink mixers, and they don’t give a wet slap about anything else. They’ll usually help Hitchhikers aboard, partly because they like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons.

## Jens Reimann

This is a personal blog about technical stuff, life, the universe and everything. Sometimes I write down ideas so that others might find them, implement them and send me a copy ;-) Some posts are “note to self”, stuff that I would like to rediscover once I forgot it. And of course a blog is great toy to play around with :-)
