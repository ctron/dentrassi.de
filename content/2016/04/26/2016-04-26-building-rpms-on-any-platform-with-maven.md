In several occasions I had to build RPM packages for installing software. In the past I mostly did it with a Maven build using the <q>[RPM Maven Plugin](http://www.mojohaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin/)</q>.

The process is simple: At the end of your build you gather up all resources, try to understand the [mapping configuration](http://www.mojohaus.org/rpm-maven-plugin/map-params.html), bang your head a few times in order to figure out way to work with `-SNAPSHOT` versions and thatâ€™s it. In the end you have a few RPM files.

<!-- more -->

The only problem is, that the plugin actually creates a <q>spec</q> file and runs the `rpmbuild` command line tool. Which is, of course, only available on an RPM like system. Fortunately Debian/Ubuntu based distributions, although they use something different, provide at least the `rpmbuild` tool.

On Windows or Mac OS the situation looks different. Adding `rpmbuild` to Windows can be quite a task. Still the question remains, why this is necessary since Java can run on all platforms.

So time to write a Maven plugin which does not the `rpmbuild` tool, but create RPM packages native in Java:

[`de.dentrassi.maven:rpm`](https://ctron.github.io/rpm-builder/) is a Maven Plugin which does create RPM packages using plain Java as a Maven Plugin. The process is simply and fast and does not require additional command line tool. The plugin is open source and the source code is available on GitHub [ctron/rpm-builder](https://github.com/ctron/rpm-builder).
