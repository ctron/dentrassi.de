About half a year back, [Cédric](https://twitter.com/bruncedric) and I did [start a test](https://dentrassi.de/2015/12/16/test-driving-mattermost-at-the-eclipse-foundation/) to see if Mattermost is a valuable tool for the Eclipse community. Failure was an option, since a new tool should bring some benefit to the community.

<!-- more -->

The server this instance was running on was sponsored by my current employer, [IBH SYSTEMS GmbH](http://ibh-systems.com). The test was scheduled to be terminate at the end of June. And since I will change to RedHat, starting in July, we were forced to make a decision:

> The mattermost instance of Eclipse has been migrated to a new server and has a new url: <https://t.co/Aa24zyLi69> [![](https://pic.twitter.com/mL9GouQTN2)](https://t.co/mL9GouQTN2)

:-) Mattermost now is a permanent, community supported service of the Eclipse Foundation. Hosted on the Eclipse Foundation’s infrastructure, but supported by its community. We also dropped the “-test” in the domain name. So please update your links, if you had some. All content was migrated to the new server.

Also did we setup a new IRC bridge, which does bridge the IRC channel #eclipse-dev on freenode to the Mattermost channel [developers-qa](https://mattermost.eclipse.org/eclipse/channels/developers-qa).

Cédric and I proposed a [talk at for EclipseCon Europe 2016](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/mattermost-eclipse-irc-web) to show the community what Mattermost is and how it can be used for engaging users and committers.

Happy chatting ;-)
