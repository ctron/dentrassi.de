This is my personal cheat sheet for managing projects at the [Eclipse Foundation](https://eclipse.org). It assumes that you already have an approved project. If you are interested in learning how to start a project at Eclipse, read [Starting a new project](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/HOWTO/Starting_A_New_Project). This document is neither an official document of the Eclipse Foundation nor <q>the way to go</q>, but maybe it helps someone.

Also see the [Eclipse project handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook).

All links in this document, which are project specific, will target the project <q>Eclipse Package Drone</q>.

## Setting up a new project

At first you will receive an e-mail telling you that your project is ready. Wait for this e-mail.

## Incubation phase

New projects will normally be started in the [Incubation phase](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/HOWTO/Incubation_Phase). This means that you have to add special branding, making others aware of the fact that your projects in in some sort of <q>early stage</q>.

## Project meta data

The Eclipse Foundation maintains a project information database which holds a set of information about the project, like repositories, descriptions, releases, reviews. You should probably [update the project metadata](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/HOWTO/Project_Meta-Data) every now and then.

## Setting up a web presence

You will get a default web presence at `http://eclipse.org/<my-project>` e.g. <http://eclipse.org/packagedrone>.

Request a web presence as described here: <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-website>
