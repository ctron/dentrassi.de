Here is another release of [Package Drone â€“ 0.0.6](https://github.com/ctron/package-drone/releases/tag/v0.0.6)!

Be sure to check out [the most recent release](https://github.com/ctron/package-drone/releases) on github.

<!-- more -->

The main changes are:

- Add automated tests using Selenium WebDriver
- Create a build system using Maven Tycho
- Create start scripts for SystemD and Upstart
- Create .deb and .rpm packages for Ubuntu 14.04 (Mint 17) and CentOS 7 (RHEL 7).
- Provide APT and YUM repositories at <http://repo.dentrassi.de>

So this release was more about build, stability and ease of installation. That is why there are also no screenshots this time ;-)
