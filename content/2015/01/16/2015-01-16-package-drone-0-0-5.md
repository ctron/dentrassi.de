I am happy to announce yet another version of [Package Drone – 0.0.5](https://github.com/ctron/package-drone/releases/tag/v0.0.5).

Be sure to check out [the most recent release](https://github.com/ctron/package-drone/releases) on github.

<!-- more -->

The main changes are:

- Switch from Pure CSS to Bootstrap
- Clean up the UI
- Add channel level meta data and channel aggregators

Also a few bugs where fixed. Sadly in 0.0.4 there was a bug which prevented the schema creation to fail. This one is fixed in the 0.0.5 release.
