Before and on Christmas most people think about people in need, and hopefully donate something. Not necessarily money, but presents as well.

But after Christmas there are lots of unwanted presents and things you don’t need, don’t like or will ever use. In most cases these items end up in the trash, at some shelf or, at best, being returned to the store.

<!-- more -->

Now just think of a different way. If you could just put those presents up at E-Bay, in a charity special. You start an auction, put up your unwanted presents and select some registered non-profit organization that will receive the money. E-bay won’t charge you for the transaction, at least for those charity auctions.

Sounds like a great idea to me.
