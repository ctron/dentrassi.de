Dear Google …

… I just did a search for some business an Google and actually the first hit and the suggestion box on the right side is the perfect match for what I was looking for. The [info box](/wp-content/uploads/Bildschirmfoto-2015-08-15-um-17.18.49.png) contains all the relevant information, including the phone number, which is a clickable link.

<!-- more -->

Now I did the search on the desktop computer and not on my mobile phone. Clicking the link automatically starts Google Hangout with a call to that telephone number, without asking for confirmation. Too bad that the computer does not have a microphone attached.

## So please…

… instead of dialing from my desktop computer, with Hangout, I would rather want to see a small confirmation box, which (once pressed “OK” or “Yes” or whatever) sends a message to my mobile phone, triggering the call to this telephone number.

Since I was already logged in with my Google Account when doing the search, there should be no problem detecting my Google registered Android phone, and sending a Google Cloud 2 Device Message which triggers the call. You can do the same using “Chrome to Phone” for web pages.

Hopefully you can add this in a future release ;-)
